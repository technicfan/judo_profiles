        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This website is a school project that turned a bit into a hobby project after all.<br>
            It's a Judo fighter profile management platform, that can be used by multiple trainers simultaneously.<br>
            In addition a judoka can also access its profile an can be given access to view others as well.<br>
            Trainers can also give each other read and write permission for profiles created by them.<br>
            At start an admin account has to be created (in cli), that can manage all accounts and<br>
            can also create a new key in case a user forgot its password.<br>
            The password for a (user) account is not created by the trainer that creates it<br>
            but the trainer creates a key, that is valid for seven days and which the user<br>
            can then use to create a password that only he/she knows.

        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>
            This is a <a href="https://github.com/django/django">Django</a> project, that also uses JavaScript for the frontend.<br>

            I use <a href="https://github.com/django-guardian/django-guardian">django-guardian</a> for per-object-permissions for the profiles.<br>
            On the client side I use <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> for easy styling, a little bit of<br>
